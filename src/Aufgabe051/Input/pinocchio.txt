Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
That little wooden bloke-io,
His nose, it grew an inch or two
With every lie he spoke-io.

Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
Thought life was just a joke-io,
'Til the morning that he met that cat
And the fox in a long red cloak-io.

They cried, Come on, Pinocchio,
We'll entertain the folk-io,
On puppet strings you'll dance and sing
From Timbuktu to Tokyo.

Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
Got sold to a trav'lin' show-kio,
Got put in a cage by a man in a rage
With a stick to give him a poke-io.

So Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
Out of that cage he brokie-io
To the land where boys just play with toys
And cuss and fight and smoke-io.

Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
He finally awoke-io
With donkey ears and little-boy tears,
And his poor wooden heart was broke-io.

So back home ran Pinocchio,
As fast as he could go-kio,
But his daddy, he had gone to sea,
So off to sea went Pinocchio.

Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
He got quite a soak-io
When he lost his sail and got ate by a whale,
And it looked like he was gonna croak-io.

But Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
A fire he did stoke-io
Inside that whale, who sneezed up a gale
And blew him out in the smoke-io.

Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
Next mornin' he awoke-io,
And he had no strings or puppety things,
And his donkey ears had disappeared,
And his nose- - surprise- - was the normal size,
And his body filt fine, not made of pine,
And he cried, Oh joy, I'm real boy,
And everything's okey-dokey-o.
